# ELI5 DeFi

## What is DeFi?

Decentralized Finance \(DeFi\) is a growing group of financial tools built on Ethereum. These tools are open for anyone to use, all you need is an Ethereum address and some Ether \(ETH\). These tools span a range of uses; you can trade crypto-tokens, take out a loan, cast a vote, and even sell art. DeFi protocols are built by individuals, teams, and companies, but many of them have plan to gradually give control over to the communities that have developed around them. 

## What makes it "Decentralized" Finance?

DeFi runs on Ethereum, which means that any computer that is part of the Ethereum Network is supporting DeFi. If you've ever heard of someone "mining" cryptocurrency, those are the computers we're talking about. Anyone is free to mine Ethereum on their computer, so the power to control the network is in the hands of the public, not any one company or government. This makes it virtually impossible to turn off or control. 

## Why should I use DeFi?

Much like how Bitcoin was developed out of disgust of government money policy, DeFi has developed out of disgust of Centralized Finance \(CeFi\), also called Traditional Finance \(TradFi\). 

DeFi promotes the concept of going "bankless" and taking control of your own assets. It lets you remove the middle-men of banks, who make money lending out \*your\* money. DeFi markets never close, so you can trade whatever you want whenever you want.
