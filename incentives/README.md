# Incentives

## Liquidity Mining, Transaction Mining, Yield Farming

Kicked off by [Compound in June 2020](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/7), distributing governance tokens to users in order to incentivize adoption has become a staple of DeFi.

* Liquidity Mining: Rewards to Liquidity Providers on DEXs, lending platforms proportional to the amount provided
* Transaction Mining: Rewards to users making trades, taking out loans, etc.
* Yield Farming: Chasing the best reward systems to get the highest returns

## Staking

You may hear a project saying that you must "stake" a token in order to get a reward. What this means is that you actually send those tokens to be held by a contract, but you should be able to get your token back at will \(though it's possible they might have a time delay\). **Do not blindly send tokens to a contract you don't trust. Check for audits, read the code, Do Your Own Research \(DYOR\).** 

Why do projects want you to stake?

* It adds "friction" to the system of you taking out your money
  * If it's easier to leave your money in, you're more likely to keep it there
* Rewards are easier to calculate
  * When only stakers are eligible for reward, developers \(or contracts\) only need to examing the staking contract in order to determine reward distribution
