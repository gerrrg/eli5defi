# Art

## Why tokenize digital art?

In a world of copy/paste, it's nearly impossible to keep track of ownership. By tokenizing it, it's much easier to track who owns what. The rights to an image, video, song, or any digital form of art can easily be proven by whomever holds an NFT for that piece.

## Do people actually buy this?

Yes, there are many online art marketplaces selling NFTs. In addition, there have been multiple successful series of randomized NFT released, most notably [CryptoPunk](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks) and [HashMasks](https://www.thehashmasks.com/).
