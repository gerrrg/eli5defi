# Games

## Is that card legit?

Thanks to the immutability of the blockchain, any rare item or card that someone might try to use in a game can be traced directly back to its origin. Fraudulent cards/items/whatever can be detected immediately.

## But I worked so hard on this game, and I have to start over on the next one?

Since everything is using the shared Ethereum network, it opens the possibility for multiple games to support the same items. So that rare sword you got for killing that evil boss monster might be useful in another game.

## What else can I do with these?

Some games let you use two NFTs to create or "breed" a new one, so you can combine and generate something totally unique.
