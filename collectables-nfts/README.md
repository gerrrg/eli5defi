## What is a Non-Fungible Token \(NFT\)?

An NFT is a unique, indivisible token that can represent ownership of just about anything. An NFT can represent a work of art, a digital playing card, a deed to a house, or really just about anything. They are defined by the standard put forth in [ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721).

Unlike Fungible Tokens \(like ETH or tokens of a specific ERC-20\), one NFT is not a drop-in replacement for another.

Simple Fungible/Non-Fungible example:

* **Fungible**: If we trade and you pay me with $5, I don't care which $5 I get.
* **Non-Fungible**: If we trade and you are to give me a place to live, I will definitely care if you give me a tent when I was expecting Windsor Castle.
