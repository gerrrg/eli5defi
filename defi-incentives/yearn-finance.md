# Yearn Finance

## Yield Farming on Steroids

Yearn allows users to easily get the best stable returns on their assets by pooling loans together and having a community constantly looking for the best rates to generate yield farming returns. 

Yearn is governed by a "[worthless](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/yearn-finance)" token called YFI.

> In further efforts to give up this control \(mostly because we are lazy and don’t want to do it\), we have released YFI, a completely valueless 0 supply token. We re-iterate, it has 0 financial value. There is no pre-mine, there is no sale, no you cannot buy it, no, it won’t be on uniswap, no, there won’t be an auction. We don’t have any of it.
