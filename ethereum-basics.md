# Ethereum Basics

## What is Ethereum?

Ethereum is a network of computers running a blockchain\*, and is similar to the technology that powers Bitcoin. Taking the concept of Bitcoin a step further though, Ethereum allows anybody to run programs on the network called Smart Contracts. 

\*A blockchain is decentralized ledger -- a public record of all transactions and balances that anyone can look at and verify. It runs on thousands of computers around the world, validating and synchronizing data.

## What is an Ethereum Wallet?

A [wallet](https://ethereum.org/en/wallets/) is a unique address that allows a user to interact with the blockchain. It maintains your ETH balance and has your transaction history. 

Each wallet has two parts: a public and private key. Think of these as account and password. To move ETH from one account to another, a user needs to sign the "send" transaction with their private key. Users also sign transactions interacting with Smart Contracts.
