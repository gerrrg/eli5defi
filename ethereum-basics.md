# Ethereum Basics

## What is Ethereum?

Ethereum is a network of computers running a blockchain\*, and is similar to the technology that powers Bitcoin. Taking the concept of Bitcoin a step further though, Ethereum allows anybody to run programs on the network called Smart Contracts. 

\*A blockchain is decentralized ledger -- a public record of all transactions and balances that anyone can look at and verify. It runs on thousands of computers around the world, validating and synchronizing data.

## What is an Ethereum Wallet?

A [wallet](https://ethereum.org/en/wallets/) is a unique address that allows a user to interact with the blockchain. It maintains your ETH balance and has your transaction history. 

Each wallet has two parts: a public and private key. Think of these as account and password. To move ETH from one account to another, a user needs to sign a "send" transaction with their private key. Users also approve transactions interacting with Smart Contracts.

## Is Ethereum free to use?

It is free in the sense that anyone is _allowed_ to use it, but there are transaction fees, called gas, associated with the network. The amount of gas you need is proportional to the amount of computation and storage that your transaction requires, and gas itself can become more expensive when there is a lot of network traffic.

## What's a seed phrase?

A seed phrase is a string of characters used to generate a private key. Most commonly, it is a list of 24 random words. You should never store your seed phrase on your computer -- you should write it down on a piece of paper and hide it somewhere memorable but secure. Whoever has this list of words has direct control over your Ethereum wallet.

## A quick note about security...

There are many people out there who want to make quick money by stealing your assets. Scammers have been making convincing websites that look like DeFi pages, but they ask you to enter your private key or seed phrase. You should not give out your private key or seed phrase to anyone. When interacting with DeFi websites, you should use a wallet provider. The most common one is called MetaMask.

If you want to go a step further, you can use a hardware wallet. This is a small device that looks like a USB flash drive. The private key is generated and stored on the device, not on your computer. When you send a transaction, the raw transaction is sent over USB to the hardware wallet for signing, and the approved transaction is sent back over USB to your computer. This never exposes your private key to anyone, even if they have access to your computer.
