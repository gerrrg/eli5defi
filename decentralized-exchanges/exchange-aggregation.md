# Exchange Aggregation

## How do I get the best price for a big trade?

When your trade is sufficiently large, making it on any one exchange might not get you the best possible trade. Slippage can eat away at your return value, and it might be cheaper to make a few trades across a few DEXs. This sounds pretty tedious though...

## How do I \*easily\* get the best price for a big trade?

Using an exchange aggregator, of course! These protocols check everything for you to get you the best exchange rate:

* Spot price
* Slippage
* Trade routing
  * It might be cheaper to go from A-&gt;B-&gt;C than A-&gt;C

## Example

* 1Inch Exchange Aggregator
