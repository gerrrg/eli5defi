# Decentralized Exchanges

## What is a DEX?

A Decentralized Exchange \(DEX\) is a system that allows users to trade crypto. DEXs never close, and most of them allow anybody to list any token they like, so long as it's compatible. In general, DEXs allow you to trade any ERC-20 token.

DEXs are built on Smart Contracts. Each DEX has a series of contracts for different trading pools. Each of these pools is an Automated Market Maker \(more below\).

DEXs are remarkable in that a trader doesn't need to trust the "other party" in a trade. These exchanges happen entirely between a trader and a contract, and the transactions are atomic, so the send of Token A happens at the same time as the receive of Token B.

## Where do the tokens come from?

People looking to passively generate income from their tokens can become liquidity providers \(LPs\) at decentralized exchanges. This means they put their own tokens into the DEX contracts and let people trade between them. When someone makes a trade, the pool gets to keep a small percentage as a fee.

## How does a DEX know what price to charge?

DEXs generally don't use outside price feeds. Instead, they have equations that set prices according to certain rules. Since anyone can trade with a DEX, anyone can make a profitable trade when the prices disagree between exchanges. This is called arbitrage, and it is how DEX prices reflect and influence market prices.

These equations are the foundations of Automated Market Makers \(AMMs\). Different DEXs use different formulas, but they all take the quantities and weight of assets into account.
