# Decentralized Exchanges

## What is a DEX?

A Decentralized Exchange \(DEX\) is a system that allows users to trade crypto. DEXs never close, and most of them allow anybody to list any token they like, so long as it's compatible. In general, DEXs allow you to trade any ERC-20 token.

DEXs are remarkable in that a trader doesn't need to trust the "other party" in a trade. These exchanges happen entirely between a trader and a contract, and the transactions are atomic, so the send of Token A happens at the same time as the receive of Token B.

## Where do the tokens come from?

People looking to passively generate income from their tokens can become liquidity providers \(LPs\) at decentralized exchanges. This means they put their own tokens into the DEX contracts and let people trade between them. When someone makes a trade, the pool gets to keep a small percentage as a fee. Different DEXs calculate token prices in slightly different ways, so we'll dive into that later.
