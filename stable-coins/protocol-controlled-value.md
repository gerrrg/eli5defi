# Protocol Controlled Value

## Buy stablecoin, deploy liquidity

While most protocols offer incentives to keep assets in their ecosystem, Protocol Controlled Value doesn't give you much of a choice. Once you buy the stablecoin, the only place you can exchange back is on secondary market exchanges \(DEXs and CEXs\). The protocols have systems in place eliminate surplus tokens \(much like how governments do\) to push the stablecoin back to its price peg.

## Pros

* Don't have to worry about fleeing capital if better rewards pop up \("Mercenary Capital"\)
* Decentralized

## Cons

* Still needs to be proven in the market
* Crypto-asset backing locked in liquidity pool forever

## Example

* FEI \(has not been deployed at time of writing\) \([more info](https://medium.com/fei-protocol/introducing-fei-protocol-2db79bd7a82b)\)
