# Crypto Backed

## Decentralize it

These are similar to fiat backed tokens, but there's a bit more work to have the token target a dollar. These protocols are over-collateralized with a healthy safety factor for protection against price swings. Protocols can create economic incentives to increase or decrease supply. If the collateral \(times a safety factor\) becomes worth less than the stablecoin, part of the collateral is sold to make up for the debt.
