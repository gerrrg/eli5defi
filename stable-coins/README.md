# Stablecoins

## What?

A stablecoin is a crypto asset that tracks a fiat \("real world"\) currency. The most common stablecoins track the United States Dollar.

## Why?

Stablecoins allow the crypto community to use these advanced new DeFi systems with assets that have significantly less volatility in value than traditional crypto assets like ETH and BTC.

## How?

There are a number of ways that stablecoins work \(or try to work\). They each have their pros and cons.

* Fiat backed
* Crypto backed
* Seigniorage
* Protocol Controlled Value
