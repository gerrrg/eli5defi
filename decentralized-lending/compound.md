## What are the interest rates?

Interest rates are set by the market. The more people who attempt to borrow, the higher the interest rates become. 

## How much collateral is needed?

Collateral is determined by Collateral Factor. If ETH has a collateral factor of 60%, you can borrow 6 ETH if your collateral is 10 ETH. 

## What happens if your collateral loses value compared to your loan?

Liquidation. Part of your collateral can be sold at a discount to market price to liquidators. This discount rate is determined by community governance.
